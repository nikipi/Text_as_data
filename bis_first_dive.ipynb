of Japan English translation based on the Japanese original Introduction Good morning It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with leaders in administrative  financial  and economic areas in Kanagawa Prefecture  which is taking place online due to the continuing impact of the novel coronavirus COVID19 I would like to take this chance to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japans Yokohama Branch Also  it is an honor to join this meeting  as I was born in Yokohama and raised in Fujisawa At the January Monetary Policy Meeting MPM  the Bank released the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices Outlook Report in which it presented the outlook for Japans economic activity and prices through fiscal 2022 Today  I will first talk about the Banks view on economic and financial developments at home and abroad by providing you an overview of the Outlook Report  and then explain the future conduct of monetary policy while touching on the thinking behind the upcoming assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing I also would like to describe economic developments in Kanagawa Prefecture at the end of my speech I Developments in Economic Activity and Prices A Developments in the Global Economy The current crisis is characterized by significant uncertainties depending on the course of COVID19 and unevenness of its impact across industries and attributes1 Let me start by looking at developments in the global economy It has picked up from a state of significant depression in the first half of 2020  although the impact of a resurgence of COVID19 has been seen in part Chart 1 However  with the number of confirmed new cases rising again in such places as the United States and Europe since last autumn  downward pressure has been exerted on the overall economy  particularly in the facetoface services industry This has been evident especially in Europe That said  production activity of the manufacturing industry and the trade volume have continued to recover  almost 1 Gopinath  G  A Race Between Vaccines and the Virus as Recoveries Diverge  IMF Blog  January 26  2021  httpsblogsimforg20210126aracebetweenvaccinesandthevirusas recoveriesdiverge 1 returning to the prepandemic level Business sentiment globally has remained on an improving trend on the whole  although the pace of a pickup is different between the manufacturing industry and the services industry As for the outlook  the global economy is likely to continue improving  partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken by each country and region That said  it is projected that the pace will be only moderate for the time being  partly due to the impact of the resurgence of COVID19  mainly in the United States and Europe The International Monetary Fund IMF also projects in the latest World Economic Outlook WEO Update that the global GDP will decline significantly in 2020 and recover in 2021 but to a level that somewhat exceeds its 2019 level In addition  we should pay attention to multilayered risks in the global economy  including various ones related to geopolitics and climate change B Developments in Japans Economy Next  I will talk about developments in Japans economy Although the economy has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID19  it has picked up as a trend from the bottom hit in the AprilMay period last year  when a wide range of economic activities were constrained The impact has been relatively small on production and transactions of goods  whereas it has been large on facetoface services Such unevenness is becoming much more evident recently With these factors in mind  let me explain each component in some detail Exports and production have continued to increase since goods transactions  including trade activity  have picked up at a relatively rapid pace Chart 2 Looking at real exports by goods  exports of automobilerelated goods have continued to increase clearly  reflecting the materialization of pentup demand  and an uptrend in ITrelated exports has been evident Exports of capital goods have turned to an increase due to a global recovery in production activity As for the outlook  with the global economy continuing to improve  exports and production are likely to increase for a wide range of goods  including capital goods and ITrelated goods 2 Business fixed investment has stopped declining on the whole  albeit with variations across industries Chart 3 Machinery investment  which had continued to decline  has picked up recently  reflecting increases in exports and production On the other hand  construction investment has remained on a moderate declining trend due to a decrease in construction of stores and accommodation facilities by the facetoface services industry According to the business fixed investment plans in the December 2020 Tankan ShortTerm Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan released by the Bank  the yearonyear rate of change in business fixed investment for fiscal 2020 is minus 24 percent Although it should be noted that the plan for this fiscal year has been gradually revised downward  the rate is negative only to a small degree when compared with that of the decline in economic activity This seems to be largely attributable to the fact that largescale adjustments in business fixed investment have been avoided due to accommodative financial conditions An analysis by the Banks staff suggests that financial institutions lending attitudes that have remained accommodative in the current phase will have an effect of pushing up the overall amount of business fixed investment to a fair degree  mainly led by small and mediumsized firms2 As for the outlook  business fixed investment is likely to pick up for the time being  led by machinery investment  and then increase further  supported by accommodative financial conditions  the governments economic measures  and improvement in corporate profits Private consumption has picked up gradually as a trend  but downward pressure has increased recently on consumption of facetoface services  such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations Chart 4 The Consumption Activity Index CAI shows that goods consumption has continued to pick up on the whole  whereas improvement in services consumption has leveled off due to the resurgence of COVID19 As the state of emergency has been reinstated for 11 prefectures  including Kanagawa Prefecture  private consumption  particularly in facetoface services  is likely to remain under strong downward pressure for the time being It is necessary to pay attention to future developments in the facetoface services industry and their impact on the employment 2 See Box 3 Extent of Transmission of the COVID19 Shock across Employment and Business Fixed Investment in the January 2021 Outlook Report httpswwwbojorjpenmopooutlook gor2101bpdf 3 situation since the proportion of small firms and nonregular employees is high in the industry The employment and income situation  which shows the underlying developments in private consumption  has remained weak Chart 5 The yearonyear rate of change in the number of employees has continued to register a negative figure  mainly due to a decrease in nonregular employees Total cash earnings per employee have declined  mainly due to a decrease in nonscheduled cash earnings Employee income therefore has declined However  the governments Employment Adjustment Subsidy  which had been expanded  has somewhat halted job cuts Bankruptcies of firms have been at low levels  mainly due to the Banks and the governments measures to support financing Suspension and discontinuation of businesses have not surged3 Under these circumstances  the decline in the number of employed persons has been constrained compared with a significant decline in economic activity Employment and income are projected to remain under downward pressure for the time being but likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter  with domestic and external demand recovering Let me sum up the outlook for Japans economy Chart 6 Downward pressure  reflecting the resurgence of COVID19  is likely to remain strong for the time being  particularly in facetoface services consumption That said  although there are high uncertainties  the Bank projects as a baseline scenario that Japans economy thereafter will follow an improving trend  albeit only moderately  supported by a recovery in external demand  accommodative financial conditions  and the governments economic measures In terms of the medians of the Policy Board members forecasts in the January 2021 Outlook Report  3 The number of suspensions and discontinuations of businesses should be interpreted with some latitude since there are several statistics with different survey subjects and methods  and there are large fluctuations in the results That is  according to the Statistics on Registration released by the Ministry of Justice  which compiles the number of firms that discontinued their businesses through registration procedure  the yearonyear rate of change is minus 32 percent for the JanuaryNovember period of 2020 Statistics compiled by the Teikoku Databank  which include the number of firms that discontinued and suspended their businesses without such procedure  show that the yearonyear rate of change is minus 53 percent for 2020 On the other hand  statistics compiled by Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd indicate that the yearonyear rate of change is 146 percent for 2020 4 the real GDP growth rate is projected to register a significant negative figure of minus 56 percent for fiscal 2020  39 percent for fiscal 2021  and 18 percent for fiscal 2022 By fiscal year  real GDP will only return to its 2019 level in around fiscal 2022 The risks to the aforementioned baseline scenario are skewed to the downside COVID19 has resurged at home and abroad  and the extent to which the impact will push down economic activity is highly uncertain It is encouraging that vaccination has started in some countries  but the pace of distribution and the effects of the vaccines entail uncertainties For the time being  attention should continue to be paid to the consequences of COVID19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies In addition  while the impact of COVID19 remains  it is also uncertain whether growth and inflation expectations will not decline substantially and financial system stability will be maintained With these factors in mind  the Bank will continue to examine developments in domestic and overseas economies carefully C Price Developments Let me move on to price developments Chart 7 The yearonyear rate of change in the consumer price index CPI  all items less fresh food has been negative That said  when excluding the effects of temporary factors such as the decline in energy prices and discounts on hotel charges through the Go To Travel campaign  the rate has been slightly positive According to anecdotal information from firms  price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not yet been observed widely to date  and the economy has not returned to deflation despite a significant decline in economic activity At present  a price decline has been seen only to a limited degree compared with that of a decline in the output gap The yearonyear rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being  but thereafter is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually with the effects of temporary factors dissipating and the economy improving Chart 6 The medians of the Policy Board members forecasts of the inflation rate in the January Outlook Report indicate that the CPI is projected to be minus 05 percent for fiscal 2020  05 percent for fiscal 2021  and 07 percent for fiscal 2022 The Bank has not judged thus far that prices will see an overall and sustained decline and that the economy will return to deflation That said  5 attention should be paid not only to the impact of COVID19 but also to risks that are specific to prices The latest Outlook Report points to two risks  which are uncertainties over firms pricesetting behavior and developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices In particular  we pay great and utmost attention to the possible impact of developments in foreign exchange rates on prices II The Banks Conduct of Monetary Policy Now  I will talk about the Banks conduct of monetary policy COVID19 has been significantly affecting developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions In this situation  the Bank judges that the following responses are important to address the COVID19 shock first and foremost to provide support for corporate financing so that firms can sustain their businesses and to maintain stability in financial markets in order to prevent deterioration in the real economy  such as in employment4 At the same time  given that downward pressure is likely to be exerted on economic activity and prices for a prolonged period due to the impact of COVID19  it is necessary to consider the appropriate future conduct of monetary policy A Monetary Policy Responses to the Impact of COVID19 Let me start with responses to be made for the time being Chart 8 The Bank has conducted powerful monetary easing since last spring in response to COVID19 through the following three measures 1 the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus COVID19 to provide support mainly for corporate financing 2 an ample and flexible provision of funds  mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds JGBs and conducting the US dollar fundssupplying operations and 3 active purchases of exchangetraded funds ETFs and Japan real estate investment trusts JREITs The Banks responses have had positive effects Chart 9 Global financial markets became highly volatile last spring but have regained stability due to largescale responses made by governments and central banks around the world  including the Bank of Japan Although 4 These responses would prevent as much as possible the impairment of human capital and firms organization capital As for organization capital  see Prescott  E C and Visscher  M  Organization Capital  Journal of Political Economy  vol 88  no 3 June 1980 pp 44661 6 firms financial positions have been weak  the environment for external funding has remained accommodative owing to the Banks and the governments responses as well as active efforts made by financial institutions Financial institutions lending attitudes have remained accommodative The yearonyear rate of change in the amount outstanding of bank lending and that in the aggregate amount outstanding of CP and corporate bonds have continued to register high growth However  with the economy improving at only a moderate pace  corporate financing is likely to remain under stress Under these circumstances  the Bank decided at the December MPM last year to extend the duration of the Special Program by six months until the end of this September  thereby continuing to provide support for corporate financing It will continue to firmly conduct the current monetary easing  including this program It also will closely monitor the impact of COVID19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary B Assessment for Further Effective and Sustainable Monetary Easing Next  I will talk about responses to be taken in the future The Bank decided to conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing  with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent  and make public its findings  likely at the March MPM I would like to first touch on the global environment surrounding the monetary policy conduct Since the Global Financial Crisis GFC during 2007 through 2008  amid the situation of a declining trend in the natural rate of interest  which balances the economys gross demand and potential GDP  low growth  low inflation  and low interest rates have been prolonged in advanced economies and the term Japanification has been discussed frequently5 6 As the policy interest rates likely will fall to the effective lower bound  the 5 For developments in the natural rate of interest in the United States  Canada  the euro area  and the United Kingdom  see Holston  K  Laubach  T  and Williams  J C  Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest International Trends and Determinants  Journal of International Economics  vol 108  pp S59S75  2017 For those in Japan  see Sudo  N  Okazaki  Y  and Takizuka  Y  Determinants of the Natural Rate of Interest in Japan Approaches Based on a DSGE Model and OG Model  BOJ Research Laboratory Series  no 18E1  2018 7 central banks of those economies have faced the common challenges of how to enhance the effectiveness and credibility of monetary policy With these challenges in mind  the central banks in the United States and Europe  the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank ECB  have reviewed their frameworks of monetary policy recently The Bank has faced these challenges earlier than these central banks It started to pursue largescale monetary easing from 2013 by introducing quantitative and qualitative monetary easing QQE In summer 2016  it conducted a comprehensive assessment  which is equivalent to a review of the framework of monetary policy Based on its findings  the Bank introduced QQE with Yield Curve Control in September 2016 This consists of yield curve control  in which the Bank controls short and longterm interest rates  and an inflationovershooting commitment  in which the Bank commits itself to expanding the monetary base until the yearonyear rate of increase in the actual CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner Under this framework  the Bank has continued with the largescale monetary easing to date The inflationovershooting commitment is a commitment to strongly influencing peoples inflation expectations with the aim of attaining a situation where the inflation rate is 2 percent on average over the business cycle In this regard  the Federal Reserve conducted a review of the monetary policy framework in terms of strategy  tools  and communications  and announced last summer that it would seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time as a makeup strategy7 8 The Federal Reserves thinking behind this review has some commonalities with the Banks that has been adopted already for the conduct of monetary policy Given that we have been addressing the same challenges  the Bank would like to take advantage of other central banks discussions and experiences 6 As for Japanification  see Wakatabe  M  Japans Economy and Monetary Policy  speech at a meeting with business leaders in Ehime  February 5  2020  httpswwwbojorjpenannouncements presskoen_2020ko200205ahtm 7 Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy  August 27  2020  httpswwwfederalreservegovmonetarypolicyfilesFOMC_LongerRunGoals_202008pdf 8 A makeup strategy is the idea that central banks compensate for past inflation shortfalls with policy stances to generate higher inflation in the future 8 As for the Banks upcoming assessment  it should start with examining the effects of QQE with Yield Curve Control on financial conditions as well as developments in economic activity and prices Let us remind ourselves of how the transmission mechanism of monetary easing works The mechanism is assumed to be as follows Chart 10 First of all  through yield curve control  nominal interest rates become stable at low levels across the entire yield curve At the same time  inflation expectations are raised through the inflationovershooting commitment As a result  real interest rates  which are calculated by subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates  stay at low levels The key here is real interest rates When the economy is in deflation  firms and households debt burden in real terms hovers at a high level even if nominal interest rates are low9 The low real interest rates improve financial conditions through low funding costs as well as favorable financial and capital markets  thereby encouraging economic activity and improving the output gap Improvement in the output gap in turn pushes up the actual inflation rate  together with a rise in inflation expectations 9 In 1923  the British economist John Maynard Keynes explained this as follows Economists draw an instructive distinction between what are termed the money rate of interest and the real rate of interest If a sum of money worth 100 in terms of commodities at the time when the loan is made is lent for a year at 5 per cent interest  and is only worth 90 in terms of commodities at the end of the year  the lender receives back  including his interest  what is only worth 9412 This is expressed by saying that while the money rate of interest was 5 per cent  the real rate of interest had actually been negative and equal to minus 512 per cent In the same way  if at the end of the period the value of money had risen and the capital sum lent had come to be worth 110 in terms of commodities  while the money rate of interest would still be 5 per cent the real rate of interest would have been 1512 per cent Such considerations  even though they are not explicitly present to the minds of the business world  are far from being academic The business world may speak  and even think  as though the money rate of interest could be considered by itself  without reference to the real rate But it does not act so The merchant or manufacturer  who is calculating whether a 7 per cent bank rate is so onerous as to compel him to curtail his operations  is very much influenced by his anticipations about the prospective price of the commodity in which he is interested Keynes  J M  A Tract on Monetary Reform London Macmillan and Co  Limited  1923  pp 2021 9 Economic and financial developments since the introduction of QQE in 2013 have been more or less in line with the assumed mechanism Charts 11  12  and 1310 Real interest rates have been clearly negative due to nominal interest rates that are extremely low and inflation expectations that are higher than those prior to the introduction of QQE In this situation  the yearonyear rate of change in the amount outstanding of bank lending has continued to be at around 2 percent In financial and capital markets  foreign exchange rates have been stable on the whole and stock prices have been on an uptrend The output gap has continued to expand since 2017  when it turned clearly positive11 The unemployment rate has declined  the active job openingstoapplicants ratio has increased  and the number of employed persons has risen12 Base pay increases have continued for seven consecutive years  and the positive annual CPI inflation has taken hold The economy is no longer in deflation in the sense of a sustained decline in prices However  the price stability target of 2 percent has not yet been achieved Even though upward pressure on wages has increased steadily  as can be seen in a rise in scheduled cash earnings per hour of parttime employees  the rate of increase in inflation expectations has not expanded This is because peoples mindset and behavior based on the assumption that prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched under prolonged deflation and it has been taking time for such mindset and behavior to change Also  firms room to raise productivity and the high elasticity of labor supply have absorbed inflationary pressure Under these circumstances  the COVID19 shock occurred last spring Because of this additional impact  inflation expectations have weakened somewhat and the output gap has deteriorated significantly Since downward pressure on economic activity and prices is 10 For a recent academic assessment on the policy  see Honda  Y and Inoue  H  The Effectiveness of the Negative Interest Rate Policy in Japan An Early Assessment  Journal of the Japanese and International Economies  vol 52 June 2019 pp 14253 11 The estimation of the output gap should be interpreted with some latitude since the results could be different depending on the estimation methods 12 Such favorable employment market outcomes have not resulted from a declining population For details  see Wakatabe  M  Japans Economy and Monetary Policy  speech at a meeting with business leaders in Aomori  June 27  2019  httpswwwbojorjpenannouncementspress koen_2019ko190627ahtm 10 likely to continue for a prolonged period  it will take considerable time to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent On this basis  the Bank will conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing  with a view to supporting the economy and thereby achieving the price stability target of 2 percent In doing so  since the price stability target of 2 percent and the framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control have been working well to date  the Bank judges that there is no need to change them There are mainly three reasons for this First  the price stability target of 2 percent has been  and remains  the starting point for pursuing monetary easing In the reviews of other central banks  which are facing challenges common to Japan  they are trying to seek more effective ways to achieve the target level  rather than lower it13 Second  as I mentioned earlier  economic and financial developments have been more or less in line with the assumed mechanism under QQE with Yield Curve Control Despite the unexpected shock of COVID19  the basic stance of the monetary policy conduct toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is reasonable Third  QQE with Yield Curve Control is a framework through which a policy mix of fiscal and monetary policies can be effectively achieved while the independence of a central bank is maintained In response to COVID19  the government has been increasing the issuance of JGBs to implement its economic measures while making use of the low interest rate environment Meanwhile  the Bank has set the target level of policy interest rates as part of the monetary policy measures  taking into account developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions  and has been achieving accommodative financial conditions accordingly Under QQE with Yield Curve Control  the Bank and the government can cooperate with each other while fulfilling their respective roles14 13 Therefore  changing the price stability target from a point to a range  say from 1 to 3 percent  could be regarded as a weakening of a commitment to monetary easing 14 For an academic discussion on a policy mix  see Bartsch  E et al  Its All in the Mix How Monetary and Fiscal Policies Can Work or Fail Together  Geneva Reports on the World Economy 23  December 2020  httpsvoxeuorgcontentitsallmixhowmonetaryandfiscalpoliciescan workorfailtogether 11 Thus  based on the assumption that the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control  it will conduct an assessment on the manner of operations and various measures such as asset purchases Whether to make changes to various measures depends on the findings of the assessment  so it is not appropriate to make any specific comments at this point That said  the assessment will be conducted with the following points in mind First  the Bank should conduct effective monetary easing while containing socalled costs of policy measures as much as possible QQE with Yield Curve Control is a framework for conducting monetary easing while striking a balance between costs and benefits  but it is necessary to seek more effective ways to conduct monetary policy in terms of finding such a balance Second  while it is expected that monetary easing will be prolonged  the Bank should enhance the sustainability of the conduct of monetary policy during normal times and be nimble in responding to changes in developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions The Bank could conduct monetary policy more flexibly in a prioritized manner depending on changes in such developments In conducting the upcoming assessment  I would like to emphasize that the Bank does not intend to tighten monetary easing It also does not aim at only containing costs of policy measures Rather  the Bank will consider how to be nimble in conducting effective monetary easing while taking care of costs So far  I have explained the Banks thinking on its monetary policy conduct Communication is an important factor in conducting monetary policy The central banks intentions are not necessarily interpreted in the way they meant  and some recent research has clarified this difficulty and proposed some ways to improve their communications15 The Bank has communicated widely to the public through various channels such as speeches  press conferences  opportunities to exchange views like todays meeting  its website  and SNS It will continue to make efforts and seek ways to explain its thinking on the monetary policy conduct  including the content of the upcoming assessment  as clearly as possible 15 As for the recent paper on how central banks should enhance their communications  see Candia  B  Coibion  O  and Gorodnichenko  Y  Communication and the Beliefs of Economic Agents  NBER Working Paper  no 27800  2020 12 III Current Situation of and Outlook for Kanagawa Prefectures Economy Next  I would like to talk about the economy of Kanagawa Prefecture As with Japans economy as a whole  the prefectures economy has picked up as a trend  although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID19 However  the pace of improvement is likely to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID19 continues In addition  the population of Kanagawa Prefecture is expected to start declining within the next few years  and the impact of the declining and aging population on the economy is likely to intensify However  the declining and aging population will not automatically lead to an economic decline The important thing is how to address and tackle the issue Kanagawa Prefecture seems to be very active in its efforts to achieve economic growth while looking to the future Here  I would like to focus on three of the most notable examples The first is the concentration of research and development RD centers While Kanagawa Prefecture has always had the largest number of people engaged in RD in Japan  the concentration of RD centers has accelerated in recent years For example  leading companies at home and abroad  as well as universities  have actively moved their RD facilities and campuses into the Keihin Coastal Area Life Innovation International Strategic Comprehensive Special Zone and the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama City  and these areas have become a major RD center in Japan Industryacademiagovernment research collaboration should give rise to internationally competitive leading industries  which will serve as an engine for technological innovation The second notable example is the development of logistics centers With its international trading ports of Yokohama  Kawasaki  and Yokosuka  Kanagawa Prefecture has long been a logistics hub for Japan  acting as a major window connecting the country with the rest of the world With the further development of the expressway network that directly connects to the capital  largescale logistics facilities equipped with stateoftheart equipment have started to be constructed one after another in recent years  mainly in the central part of the prefecture along these expressways More efficient and upgraded logistics will contribute to 13 raising productivity regardless of industry The importance of Kanagawa Prefecture as a key logistics hub is expected to continue increasing in the future The third example is developments linked to tourism Kanagawa Prefecture is blessed with many tourist resources  including Yokohama City  an urban tourist destination  Hakone  one of the best hot spring resorts in Japan  Kamakura  a place of history and culture  and ShonanEnoshima  an area for marine sports However  at present  the number of visitors to these tourist spots has been declining significantly with the COVID19 pandemic  and the situation has been extremely severe That said  I have heard that  even in this situation  many firms have responded flexibly to the changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic and have made efforts to meet the needs  for example  of those who want to stay longer in one place and enjoy leisure time and meals There is also active promotion of tourism from a longerterm perspective For example  Kamakura City is working to increase the number of tourists in response to the fact that the city is the setting for the 2022 NHK Taiga Drama the annual yearlong historical drama television series produced by NHK Japan Broadcasting Corporation Kamakuradono no 13nin 13 Samurais of the Kamakura Shogunate In addition  Yokohama City is scheduled to host the World Horticultural Exhibition in 2027 These various efforts are expected to boost further development of the tourism industry Kanagawa Prefecture has a long history of close ties with foreign countries It opened its ports to the world about 160 years ago with the arrival of Commodore Perry As it developed as the gateway to Japan  new cultures  knowledge  and ways of thinking flowed in along with people and goods  and the economy of the prefecture grew while taking them in with flexibility This flexibility  I believe  has been the driving force for the prefecture to respond to the recent various changes in the environment and has led to active efforts to foster and develop industry I hope that Kanagawa Prefecture maximizes its potential and continues to make strong strides toward further growth 14 Conclusion Lastly  I would like to briefly touch on the medium to longterm economic issues confronting Japan There is concern that the COVID19 shock we are facing will remain for a long time as scarring effects16 In Japan  after major shocks such as the bursting of the bubble economy and the GFC  their effects lasted for a prolonged period as sort of hysteresis effects peoples sentiment deteriorated and the growth rate suddenly decelerated Chart 14 It is important to avoid such scarring effects on the economy as much as possible in order to create a situation where Japans economy will return to a sustainable growth path without any sudden deceleration once the impact of COVID19 subsides Therefore  the top priority is to overcome the crisis as swiftly as possible at the same time  it is also important to strengthen the growth potential while making the most of lessons learned from this crisis While COVID19 has had a significant impact on social and economic activities  this also could be an opportunity to reform the economic structure that will strengthen the growth potential In fact  there have been various efforts to use information and communication technology ICT in such areas as telework and online medical care It is essential to see how society as a whole can make the most of the harsh experience of COVID19 Active investment  particularly in human capital  is necessary in order to strengthen the growth potential17 While the leading role in this regard falls on the private sector  the public

       "      <td>Philip Lowe The year ahead Address by Mr Philip Lowe  Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  to the National Press Club of Australia  Canberra  3 February 2021 Thank you for the invitation to address the National Press Club This is the third time I have had the privilege of doing so  but it is the first time here in Canberra The world has changed tremendously since my previous address in February last year a pandemic  the biggest contraction in output in generations  the closure of our borders  a very large fiscal stimulus  near zero interest rates and quantitative easing All that in just a year and none of it was predicted It was therefore with some trepidation that I titled my remarks today  The Year Ahead I did so  though  because at the start of a new year  I thought it important to explain how we are thinking about the Australian economy and monetary policy over the year ahead Before I do this  I would like to offer 3 observations on the year we have just been through The first is that Australians respond well in a crisis The second is that the economic downturn was not as deep as was initially feared and the bounceback has been earlier and stronger than we were expecting And the third is that as we start 2021  there is still quite a way to go before we reach our goals of full employment and inflation consistent with the target I would like to elaborate on each of these observations as they are relevant to the future The national response First  our national response As a community  we have pulled together in the common good and been prepared to do what has been necessary to contain the virus Our public administration and health systems have worked well in the public interest Governments responded quickly to the pandemic and decisive fiscal and monetary policy responses have helped many people Our banks also worked with their customers to help them meet their obligations Because of these collective efforts Australia is in a much better place than most other countries This is true for both the economy and the health situation An earlier and stronger bounceback My second observation is that despite the pandemic having very significant economic costs  the downturn was not as deep as we had feared and the recovery has started earlier and has been stronger than we were expecting Employment growth has been strong  as have retail sales and new house building Across many indicators  including GDP  the outcomes have been better than our central forecasts and often better than our upside scenarios as well As an illustration  in August our central forecast was that the unemployment rate would end 2020 at close to 10 per cent and still be above 7 per cent at the end of 2022 Graph 1 In our upside scenario  the unemployment rate was expected to end 2020 a little lower than 10 per cent  but still be around 7 per cent later this year Thankfully  the actual outcome for the unemployment rate has been much better than this  with the peak now looking to be behind us and the unemployment rate ending 2020 at 66 per cent Graph 1 1  7 BIS central bankers speeches It is reasonable to ask what explains these betterthanexpected outcomes There are 3 factors that I would like to point to The first is the success that Australia has had in containing the virus That success has meant that the restrictions on activity have been less disruptive than we feared It has allowed more of us to get back to work sooner and it has reduced some of the economic scarring from the pandemic As is increasingly clear from experience both here and overseas  the health of the population and the health of the economy are inextricably linked The second factor is the very significant fiscal policy support in Australia  which as measured by the change in the aggregate budget position is almost 15 per cent of GDP Graph 2 Most of this support has been delivered by the Australian Government  but the states and territories have also played a role too This support has been more substantial than was assumed in August and has made a real difference It has provided a welcome boost to incomes and jobs and helped front load the recovery by creating incentives for people to bring forward spending There has also been a positive interaction with the better health outcomes  which have allowed the policy support to gain more traction than would otherwise have been the case Graph 2 The third factor is that Australians adapted and innovated When the virus first came to our shores  many people hunkered down  but as the days wore on  households and businesses adjusted and changed what they do and how they do it This resilience has helped keep the economy going and kept people in jobs Many firms changed their business models  moved online  used new technologies and reconfigured their supply lines Households adjusted too  with spending patterns changing very significantly Some of the spending that would normally have been done on travel and entertainment has been redirected to other areas  including electrical goods  homewares and home renovations Online spending also surged  increasing by 70 per cent over the past year Graph 3 These changes in our spending patterns have been challenging for many businesses  but the ability and willingness of Australians to keep spending has helped the overall economy Graph 3 Still quite a way to go My third observation is that despite the positive economic news over recent months  we still have quite a way to go There is still very substantial spare capacity in the Australian economy The unemployment rate is higher today than it has been for almost 2 decades and many people cant get the hours of work they want And in terms of output  we remain well behind where we thought we would be when I spoke here in February last year Graph 4 When the National Accounts are published for the December quarter  they are likely to show that the level of GDP is 4 per cent lower than where we thought it would be a year ago This is a big gap Graph 4 2  7 BIS central bankers speeches On the nominal side of the economy  there is also a fair way to go In underlying terms  inflation is running at 1¼ per cent  well below the mediumterm target of 23 per cent And wage growth is the lowest in decades  with the Wage Price Index increasing by just 14 per cent over the past year Graph 5 Given the spare capacity that currently exists  these low rates of inflation and wage increases are likely to be with us for some time Graph 5 The year ahead This brings me to the year ahead In my view  we can draw some comfort from the year just passed Our ability to pull together and the earlierthanexpected bounceback are both positive developments and provide a basis for confidence about the future Yet even so  the path ahead is likely to be bumpy and uneven and it will be some time before we are back to full employment and have inflation back to the target As was the case in 2020  much depends upon the path of the pandemic The development of vaccines in record time is clearly good news It has reduced one of the big uncertainties and could provide the foundation for a vigorous and sustainable recovery in the global economy But this outcome is not assured  the global rollout of the vaccines faces challenges and there are a range of other uncertainties about the global economy  including trade tensions We hope for the best here  but we also need to be prepared for further setbacks in what remains a highly uncertain world The RBA will be releasing a full set of updated economic forecasts on Friday Today  I can provide the key numbers In preparing these forecasts we have assumed a rollout of the vaccines in Australia in line with current government guidance and that international travel remains highly restricted for the rest of this year Our central scenario is for the upswing in the Australian economy to continue  with abovetrend growth over the next couple of years Graph 6 GDP is expected to increase by 3½ per cent over both this year and 2022 Given the recovery we have seen so far  we are expecting the level of GDP to return to its end2019 level by the middle of this year  which is 6 to 12 months earlier than we previously expected Graph 6 Notwithstanding this recovery  we are not expecting the level of GDP to return to its previous trend over our forecast period This is largely because of lower population growth When we prepared the forecasts a year ago  we were expecting the population to grow by 16 per cent per year over 2020 and 2021 The actual outcome is likely to be around 02 per cent in 2021  the lowest since World War I Graph 7 This slower population growth has a direct effect on the size of our economy and means that we will not get back to the previous trend any time soon In per capita terms  we expect more  but not all  of the lost ground to be made up Graph 7 In the labour market  we are expecting the rate of unemployment to continue to decline In the central scenario  it is expected to reach 6 per cent by the end of this year and around 5¼ per cent by mid 2023 Graph 8 Job vacancies  job ads and business hiring intentions are at 3  7 BIS central bankers speeches high levels  which suggests continuing solid employment growth over the next few months Beyond that  some slowing in employment growth is expected when the JobKeeper program comes to an end in March Graph 8 Given this outlook  wages growth and inflation are forecast to remain subdued In the central scenario  wages growth is forecast to pick up from its current low rate  but to do so only very gradually and still be below 2 per cent at the end of next year Consistent with this  and the ongoing spare capacity in the economy  inflation in underlying terms is also forecast to stay below 2 per cent over the next couple of years the central forecast for 2021 is 1¼ per cent and for 2022 it is 1½ per cent Graph 9 In headline terms  inflation is expected to spike to around 3 per cent in the June quarter  largely reflecting swings in the prices of child care and some other administered prices  but then to return to below 2 per cent by the end of this year Graph 9 So that is the broad outline of the central scenario We will also be publishing downside and upside scenarios  as we did last year The downside scenario is one in which there is a combination of further sporadic domestic outbreaks  a delay in the rollout of vaccines and a worsening global outlook The upside involves further good news on the health front  with a strong pickup in consumer and business confidence propelling a stronger selfsustaining recovery  especially given the large amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus that is in place In the downside scenario  further progress in reducing unemployment is delayed and there is a little pickup wage growth and inflation from current levels In the upside scenario  the unemployment rate falls faster to be a bit below 5 per cent in the second half of next year I would like to highlight 2 specific issues that have a bearing on the forecasts The first is how households respond over coming months to the tapering of the fiscal and other support measures Unusually for an economic downturn  growth in household income has been quite strong  largely reflecting the support provided by fiscal policy Graph 10 Much of this extra income has been saved  with the household saving rate surging to 22 per cent in the June quarter This largely reflects the limited spending opportunities during the lockdowns  but it is also a response to the uncertainty that people felt about the future These extra savings have strengthened household balance sheets and mean that many people now have bigger financial buffers than they had previously Graph 10 The question is what comes next Over the next 6 months  aggregate household income is expected to decline as the pandemic support payments unwind Normally  when income falls  so too does consumption But we are not in normal times The extra savings over the past 6 months and the bigger financial buffers can support future spending  people will have more freedom to spend as restrictions are eased and be more willing to spend as uncertainty recedes So we are expecting the recovery in consumer spending to continue 4  7 BIS central bankers speeches But there are risks to the forecasts in both directions here On the downside  further bad news on the health front could see additional restrictions on activity and a renewed desire to save And on the upside  positive news on health and jobs could see people seek to catch up on spending and run down their extra saving buffers quickly So we are watching this area carefully One other important factor bearing on household spending is the housing market When I spoke here last year I discussed how falling housing prices was one of the factors that had contributed to sluggish growth in 2019 The dynamics in the housing market now look to be in a different phase  with prices rising across most of the country recently Graph 11 It remains to be seen how long this will continue  but sustainable increases in asset prices support household balance sheets and encourage spending through positive wealth effects Higher housing prices can also encourage additional residential construction But as housing prices rise again  we will be monitoring lending standards closely We would be concerned if there were to be a deterioration in these standards  but there are few signs of this at the moment Graph 11 The second specific issue I want to highlight is the outlook for investment Prior to the pandemic  there were concerns about the protracted period of low levels of non mining business investment Graph 12 Not surprisingly  when the pandemic hit  investment fell further Faced with a more uncertain environment and a drop in demand  many firms deferred investment plans and sought to derisk their balance sheets Spending on nonresidential construction has been particularly affected On a more positive note  there has been a welcome offsetting pickup in public investment  which is playing a strong counter cyclical role We are yet to see the same signs of a recovery in private investment that we have witnessed in household spending Investment is nonetheless expected to pick up as uncertainty recedes and demand increases An increase in private business investment is not only needed to support the economic recovery but also to build the productive capital stock that is needed for our future So this too is an issue we are watching carefully Graph 12 Monetary policy I would now like to turn to monetary policy At our meeting yesterday  the Reserve Bank Board reviewed the monetary policy measures announced last year and the outlook for the year ahead I would like to share the conclusions of this review with you The first conclusion is that last years monetary policy package is working broadly as expected and is supporting the economy Together  the bond purchases  the Term Funding Facility  the 3 year yield target and the record low cash rate have kept funding costs low for all borrowers and helped ensure that the banking system is able to provide the credit that is needed for the recovery They have also resulted in a lower value of the Australian dollar than otherwise Combined  the various measures have resulted in the RBAs balance sheet increasing from around 180 billion to 330 billion and a further substantial increase is in prospect Graph 13 Graph 13 5  7 BIS central bankers speeches The second conclusion is that very significant monetary support will need to be maintained for some time to come It is going to be some years before the goals for inflation and unemployment are achieved So it is premature to be considering withdrawal of the monetary stimulus The third conclusion is that we will continue to purchase bonds issued by the Australian Government and the states and territories at the completion of the current 100 billion program in mid April In reaching this conclusion  the Board considered 3 factors 1 the effectiveness of the bond purchases 2 the decisions of other central banks and 3 most importantly  the outlook for inflation and jobs With 3 months experience now  it is clear that the bond purchase program has helped to lower interest rates and has meant that the Australian dollar is lower than it otherwise would have been So  it has worked Australias government bond markets also continue to function well and the available evidence is that further purchases would not be a source of market dysfunction In terms of other central banks  most have recently announced extensions of their bond purchase programs  many running until at least the end of this year Given this  if we were to cease bond purchases in April  it is likely that there would be unwelcome upward pressure on the exchange rate And  third  in terms of the most important consideration  the outlooks for inflation and jobs  we remain well short of our goals  as I have already discussed Given these considerations and the fact that the cash rate is at its effective lower bound  the Board decided to purchase an additional 100 billion of government bonds at the completion of the current program in mid April These additional purchases will be at the rate of 5 billion a week  which is unchanged from the current program They will ensure a continuation of the RBAs monetary support for the Australian economy The fourth conclusion is that the Term Funding Facility will be maintained as it is Banks are able to draw on the facility up until end June  which means they will have the benefit of lowcost funding out to mid 2024 The Board would consider extending this facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding and credit conditions in the Australian financial system At the moment  there are no signs of this Fifth  the 3year yield target for Australian Government bonds will be maintained This target has helped anchor the Australian yield curve and reinforced our forward guidance regarding the cash rate Later in the year  the Board will need to consider whether to shift the focus of the yield target from the April 2024 bond to November 2024 bond In considering this issue the Board will be giving close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlooks for inflation and jobs It has made no decision yet The final conclusion is that the cash rate will be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as is necessary Graph 14 The Board has no appetite to go into negative territory and has done as much as it reasonably can with interest rates Before increasing the cash rate  the Board wants to see inflation sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range Meeting this condition will require a tighter labour market and stronger wages growth than we are currently forecasting It is difficult to determine exactly when this condition might be met but  based on the outlook I have discussed today  we do not expect it to be before 2024  and it is possible that it will be later than this So the message is interest rates are going to be low for quite a while yet The Reserve 6  7 BIS central bankers speeches Bank is committed to provide the

Japan English translation based on the Japanese original Introduction Good morning It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with leaders in administrative  financial  and economic areas in Kanagawa Prefecture  which is taking place online due to the continuing impact of the novel coronavirus COVID19 I would like to take this chance to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japans Yokohama Branch Also  it is an honor to join this meeting  as I was born in Yokohama and raised in Fujisawa At the January Monetary Policy Meeting MPM  the Bank released the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices Outlook Report in which it presented the outlook for Japans economic activity and prices through fiscal 2022 Today  I will first talk about the Banks view on economic and financial developments at home and abroad by providing you an overview of the Outlook Report  and then explain the future conduct of monetary policy while touching on the thinking behind the upcoming assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing I also would like to describe economic developments in Kanagawa Prefecture at the end of my speech I Developments in Economic Activity and Prices A Developments in the Global Economy The current crisis is characterized by significant uncertainties depending on the course of COVID19 and unevenness of its impact across industries and attributes1 Let me start by looking at developments in the global economy It has picked up from a state of significant depression in the first half of 2020  although the impact of a resurgence of COVID19 has been seen in part Chart 1 However  with the number of confirmed new cases rising again in such places as the United States and Europe since last autumn  downward pressure has been exerted on the overall economy  particularly in the facetoface services industry This has been evident especially in Europe That said  production activity of the manufacturing industry and the trade volume have continued to recover  almost 1 Gopinath  G  A Race Between Vaccines and the Virus as Recoveries Diverge  IMF Blog  January 26  2021  httpsblogsimforg20210126aracebetweenvaccinesandthevirusas recoveriesdiverge 1 returning to the prepandemic level Business sentiment globally has remained on an improving trend on the whole  although the pace of a pickup is different between the manufacturing industry and the services industry As for the outlook  the global economy is likely to continue improving  partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken by each country and region That said  it is projected that the pace will be only moderate for the time being  partly due to the impact of the resurgence of COVID19  mainly in the United States and Europe The International Monetary Fund IMF also projects in the latest World Economic Outlook WEO Update that the global GDP will decline significantly in 2020 and recover in 2021 but to a level that somewhat exceeds its 2019 level In addition  we should pay attention to multilayered risks in the global economy  including various ones related to geopolitics and climate change B Developments in Japans Economy Next  I will talk about developments in Japans economy Although the economy has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID19  it has picked up as a trend from the bottom hit in the AprilMay period last year  when a wide range of economic activities were constrained The impact has been relatively small on production and transactions of goods  whereas it has been large on facetoface services Such unevenness is becoming much more evident recently With these factors in mind  let me explain each component in some detail Exports and production have continued to increase since goods transactions  including trade activity  have picked up at a relatively rapid pace Chart 2 Looking at real exports by goods  exports of automobilerelated goods have continued to increase clearly  reflecting the materialization of pentup demand  and an uptrend in ITrelated exports has been evident Exports of capital goods have turned to an increase due to a global recovery in production activity As for the outlook  with the global economy continuing to improve  exports and production are likely to increase for a wide range of goods  including capital goods and ITrelated goods 2 Business fixed investment has stopped declining on the whole  albeit with variations across industries Chart 3 Machinery investment  which had continued to decline  has picked up recently  reflecting increases in exports and production On the other hand  construction investment has remained on a moderate declining trend due to a decrease in construction of stores and accommodation facilities by the facetoface services industry According to the business fixed investment plans in the December 2020 Tankan ShortTerm Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan released by the Bank  the yearonyear rate of change in business fixed investment for fiscal 2020 is minus 24 percent Although it should be noted that the plan for this fiscal year has been gradually revised downward  the rate is negative only to a small degree when compared with that of the decline in economic activity This seems to be largely attributable to the fact that largescale adjustments in business fixed investment have been avoided due to accommodative financial conditions An analysis by the Banks staff suggests that financial institutions lending attitudes that have remained accommodative in the current phase will have an effect of pushing up the overall amount of business fixed investment to a fair degree  mainly led by small and mediumsized firms2 As for the outlook  business fixed investment is likely to pick up for the time being  led by machinery investment  and then increase further  supported by accommodative financial conditions  the governments economic measures  and improvement in corporate profits Private consumption has picked up gradually as a trend  but downward pressure has increased recently on consumption of facetoface services  such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations Chart 4 The Consumption Activity Index CAI shows that goods consumption has continued to pick up on the whole  whereas improvement in services consumption has leveled off due to the resurgence of COVID19 As the state of emergency has been reinstated for 11 prefectures  including Kanagawa Prefecture  private consumption  particularly in facetoface services  is likely to remain under strong downward pressure for the time being It is necessary to pay attention to future developments in the facetoface services industry and their impact on the employment 2 See Box 3 Extent of Transmission of the COVID19 Shock across Employment and Business Fixed Investment in the January 2021 Outlook Report httpswwwbojorjpenmopooutlook gor2101bpdf 3 situation since the proportion of small firms and nonregular employees is high in the industry The employment and income situation  which shows the underlying developments in private consumption  has remained weak Chart 5 The yearonyear rate of change in the number of employees has continued to register a negative figure  mainly due to a decrease in nonregular employees Total cash earnings per employee have declined  mainly due to a decrease in nonscheduled cash earnings Employee income therefore has declined However  the governments Employment Adjustment Subsidy  which had been expanded  has somewhat halted job cuts Bankruptcies of firms have been at low levels  mainly due to the Banks and the governments measures to support financing Suspension and discontinuation of businesses have not surged3 Under these circumstances  the decline in the number of employed persons has been constrained compared with a significant decline in economic activity Employment and income are projected to remain under downward pressure for the time being but likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter  with domestic and external demand recovering Let me sum up the outlook for Japans economy Chart 6 Downward pressure  reflecting the resurgence of COVID19  is likely to remain strong for the time being  particularly in facetoface services consumption That said  although there are high uncertainties  the Bank projects as a baseline scenario that Japans economy thereafter will follow an improving trend  albeit only moderately  supported by a recovery in external demand  accommodative financial conditions  and the governments economic measures In terms of the medians of the Policy Board members forecasts in the January 2021 Outlook Report  3 The number of suspensions and discontinuations of businesses should be interpreted with some latitude since there are several statistics with different survey subjects and methods  and there are large fluctuations in the results That is  according to the Statistics on Registration released by the Ministry of Justice  which compiles the number of firms that discontinued their businesses through registration procedure  the yearonyear rate of change is minus 32 percent for the JanuaryNovember period of 2020 Statistics compiled by the Teikoku Databank  which include the number of firms that discontinued and suspended their businesses without such procedure  show that the yearonyear rate of change is minus 53 percent for 2020 On the other hand  statistics compiled by Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd indicate that the yearonyear rate of change is 146 percent for 2020 4 the real GDP growth rate is projected to register a significant negative figure of minus 56 percent for fiscal 2020  39 percent for fiscal 2021  and 18 percent for fiscal 2022 By fiscal year  real GDP will only return to its 2019 level in around fiscal 2022 The risks to the aforementioned baseline scenario are skewed to the downside COVID19 has resurged at home and abroad  and the extent to which the impact will push down economic activity is highly uncertain It is encouraging that vaccination has started in some countries  but the pace of distribution and the effects of the vaccines entail uncertainties For the time being  attention should continue to be paid to the consequences of COVID19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies In addition  while the impact of COVID19 remains  it is also uncertain whether growth and inflation expectations will not decline substantially and financial system stability will be maintained With these factors in mind  the Bank will continue to examine developments in domestic and overseas economies carefully C Price Developments Let me move on to price developments Chart 7 The yearonyear rate of change in the consumer price index CPI  all items less fresh food has been negative That said  when excluding the effects of temporary factors such as the decline in energy prices and discounts on hotel charges through the Go To Travel campaign  the rate has been slightly positive According to anecdotal information from firms  price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not yet been observed widely to date  and the economy has not returned to deflation despite a significant decline in economic activity At present  a price decline has been seen only to a limited degree compared with that of a decline in the output gap The yearonyear rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being  but thereafter is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually with the effects of temporary factors dissipating and the economy improving Chart 6 The medians of the Policy Board members forecasts of the inflation rate in the January Outlook Report indicate that the CPI is projected to be minus 05 percent for fiscal 2020  05 percent for fiscal 2021  and 07 percent for fiscal 2022 The Bank has not judged thus far that prices will see an overall and sustained decline and that the economy will return to deflation That said  5 attention should be paid not only to the impact of COVID19 but also to risks that are specific to prices The latest Outlook Report points to two risks  which are uncertainties over firms pricesetting behavior and developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices In particular  we pay great and utmost attention to the possible impact of developments in foreign exchange rates on prices II The Banks Conduct of Monetary Policy Now  I will talk about the Banks conduct of monetary policy COVID19 has been significantly affecting developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions In this situation  the Bank judges that the following responses are important to address the COVID19 shock first and foremost to provide support for corporate financing so that firms can sustain their businesses and to maintain stability in financial markets in order to prevent deterioration in the real economy  such as in employment4 At the same time  given that downward pressure is likely to be exerted on economic activity and prices for a prolonged period due to the impact of COVID19  it is necessary to consider the appropriate future conduct of monetary policy A Monetary Policy Responses to the Impact of COVID19 Let me start with responses to be made for the time being Chart 8 The Bank has conducted powerful monetary easing since last spring in response to COVID19 through the following three measures 1 the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus COVID19 to provide support mainly for corporate financing 2 an ample and flexible provision of funds  mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds JGBs and conducting the US dollar fundssupplying operations and 3 active purchases of exchangetraded funds ETFs and Japan real estate investment trusts JREITs The Banks responses have had positive effects Chart 9 Global financial markets became highly volatile last spring but have regained stability due to largescale responses made by governments and central banks around the world  including the Bank of Japan Although 4 These responses would prevent as much as possible the impairment of human capital and firms organization capital As for organization capital  see Prescott  E C and Visscher  M  Organization Capital  Journal of Political Economy  vol 88  no 3 June 1980 pp 44661 6 firms financial positions have been weak  the environment for external funding has remained accommodative owing to the Banks and the governments responses as well as active efforts made by financial institutions Financial institutions lending attitudes have remained accommodative The yearonyear rate of change in the amount outstanding of bank lending and that in the aggregate amount outstanding of CP and corporate bonds have continued to register high growth However  with the economy improving at only a moderate pace  corporate financing is likely to remain under stress Under these circumstances  the Bank decided at the December MPM last year to extend the duration of the Special Program by six months until the end of this September  thereby continuing to provide support for corporate financing It will continue to firmly conduct the current monetary easing  including this program It also will closely monitor the impact of COVID19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary B Assessment for Further Effective and Sustainable Monetary Easing Next  I will talk about responses to be taken in the future The Bank decided to conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing  with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent  and make public its findings  likely at the March MPM I would like to first touch on the global environment surrounding the monetary policy conduct Since the Global Financial Crisis GFC during 2007 through 2008  amid the situation of a declining trend in the natural rate of interest  which balances the economys gross demand and potential GDP  low growth  low inflation  and low interest rates have been prolonged in advanced economies and the term Japanification has been discussed frequently5 6 As the policy interest rates likely will fall to the effective lower bound  the 5 For developments in the natural rate of interest in the United States  Canada  the euro area  and the United Kingdom  see Holston  K  Laubach  T  and Williams  J C  Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest International Trends and Determinants  Journal of International Economics  vol 108  pp S59S75  2017 For those in Japan  see Sudo  N  Okazaki  Y  and Takizuka  Y  Determinants of the Natural Rate of Interest in Japan Approaches Based on a DSGE Model and OG Model  BOJ Research Laboratory Series  no 18E1  2018 7 central banks of those economies have faced the common challenges of how to enhance the effectiveness and credibility of monetary policy With these challenges in mind  the central banks in the United States and Europe  the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank ECB  have reviewed their frameworks of monetary policy recently The Bank has faced these challenges earlier than these central banks It started to pursue largescale monetary easing from 2013 by introducing quantitative and qualitative monetary easing QQE In summer 2016  it conducted a comprehensive assessment  which is equivalent to a review of the framework of monetary policy Based on its findings  the Bank introduced QQE with Yield Curve Control in September 2016 This consists of yield curve control  in which the Bank controls short and longterm interest rates  and an inflationovershooting commitment  in which the Bank commits itself to expanding the monetary base until the yearonyear rate of increase in the actual CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner Under this framework  the Bank has continued with the largescale monetary easing to date The inflationovershooting commitment is a commitment to strongly influencing peoples inflation expectations with the aim of attaining a situation where the inflation rate is 2 percent on average over the business cycle In this regard  the Federal Reserve conducted a review of the monetary policy framework in terms of strategy  tools  and communications  and announced last summer that it would seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time as a makeup strategy7 8 The Federal Reserves thinking behind this review has some commonalities with the Banks that has been adopted already for the conduct of monetary policy Given that we have been addressing the same challenges  the Bank would like to take advantage of other central banks discussions and experiences 6 As for Japanification  see Wakatabe  M  Japans Economy and Monetary Policy  speech at a meeting with business leaders in Ehime  February 5  2020  httpswwwbojorjpenannouncements presskoen_2020ko200205ahtm 7 Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy  August 27  2020  httpswwwfederalreservegovmonetarypolicyfilesFOMC_LongerRunGoals_202008pdf 8 A makeup strategy is the idea that central banks compensate for past inflation shortfalls with policy stances to generate higher inflation in the future 8 As for the Banks upcoming assessment  it should start with examining the effects of QQE with Yield Curve Control on financial conditions as well as developments in economic activity and prices Let us remind ourselves of how the transmission mechanism of monetary easing works The mechanism is assumed to be as follows Chart 10 First of all  through yield curve control  nominal interest rates become stable at low levels across the entire yield curve At the same time  inflation expectations are raised through the inflationovershooting commitment As a result  real interest rates  which are calculated by subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates  stay at low levels The key here is real interest rates When the economy is in deflation  firms and households debt burden in real terms hovers at a high level even if nominal interest rates are low9 The low real interest rates improve financial conditions through low funding costs as well as favorable financial and capital markets  thereby encouraging economic activity and improving the output gap Improvement in the output gap in turn pushes up the actual inflation rate  together with a rise in inflation expectations 9 In 1923  the British economist John Maynard Keynes explained this as follows Economists draw an instructive distinction between what are termed the money rate of interest and the real rate of interest If a sum of money worth 100 in terms of commodities at the time when the loan is made is lent for a year at 5 per cent interest  and is only worth 90 in terms of commodities at the end of the year  the lender receives back  including his interest  what is only worth 9412 This is expressed by saying that while the money rate of interest was 5 per cent  the real rate of interest had actually been negative and equal to minus 512 per cent In the same way  if at the end of the period the value of money had risen and the capital sum lent had come to be worth 110 in terms of commodities  while the money rate of interest would still be 5 per cent the real rate of interest would have been 1512 per cent Such considerations  even though they are not explicitly present to the minds of the business world  are far from being academic The business world may speak  and even think  as though the money rate of interest could be considered by itself  without reference to the real rate But it does not act so The merchant or manufacturer  who is calculating whether a 7 per cent bank rate is so onerous as to compel him to curtail his operations  is very much influenced by his anticipations about the prospective price of the commodity in which he is interested Keynes  J M  A Tract on Monetary Reform London Macmillan and Co  Limited  1923  pp 2021 9 Economic and financial developments since the introduction of QQE in 2013 have been more or less in line with the assumed mechanism Charts 11  12  and 1310 Real interest rates have been clearly negative due to nominal interest rates that are extremely low and inflation expectations that are higher than those prior to the introduction of QQE In this situation  the yearonyear rate of change in the amount outstanding of bank lending has continued to be at around 2 percent In financial and capital markets  foreign exchange rates have been stable on the whole and stock prices have been on an uptrend The output gap has continued to expand since 2017  when it turned clearly positive11 The unemployment rate has declined  the active job openingstoapplicants ratio has increased  and the number of employed persons has risen12 Base pay increases have continued for seven consecutive years  and the positive annual CPI inflation has taken hold The economy is no longer in deflation in the sense of a sustained decline in prices However  the price stability target of 2 percent has not yet been achieved Even though upward pressure on wages has increased steadily  as can be seen in a rise in scheduled cash earnings per hour of parttime employees  the rate of increase in inflation expectations has not expanded This is because peoples mindset and behavior based on the assumption that prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched under prolonged deflation and it has been taking time for such mindset and behavior to change Also  firms room to raise productivity and the high elasticity of labor supply have absorbed inflationary pressure Under these circumstances  the COVID19 shock occurred last spring Because of this additional impact  inflation expectations have weakened somewhat and the output gap has deteriorated significantly Since downward pressure on economic activity and prices is 10 For a recent academic assessment on the policy  see Honda  Y and Inoue  H  The Effectiveness of the Negative Interest Rate Policy in Japan An Early Assessment  Journal of the Japanese and International Economies  vol 52 June 2019 pp 14253 11 The estimation of the output gap should be interpreted with some latitude since the results could be different depending on the estimation methods 12 Such favorable employment market outcomes have not resulted from a declining population For details  see Wakatabe  M  Japans Economy and Monetary Policy  speech at a meeting with business leaders in Aomori  June 27  2019  httpswwwbojorjpenannouncementspress koen_2019ko190627ahtm 10 likely to continue for a prolonged period  it will take considerable time to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent On this basis  the Bank will conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing  with a view to supporting the economy and thereby achieving the price stability target of 2 percent In doing so  since the price stability target of 2 percent and the framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control have been working well to date  the Bank judges that there is no need to change them There are mainly three reasons for this First  the price stability target of 2 percent has been  and remains  the starting point for pursuing monetary easing In the reviews of other central banks  which are facing challenges common to Japan  they are trying to seek more effective ways to achieve the target level  rather than lower it13 Second  as I mentioned earlier  economic and financial developments have been more or less in line with the assumed mechanism under QQE with Yield Curve Control Despite the unexpected shock of COVID19  the basic stance of the monetary policy conduct toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is reasonable Third  QQE with Yield Curve Control is a framework through which a policy mix of fiscal and monetary policies can be effectively achieved while the independence of a central bank is maintained In response to COVID19  the government has been increasing the issuance of JGBs to implement its economic measures while making use of the low interest rate environment Meanwhile  the Bank has set the target level of policy interest rates as part of the monetary policy measures  taking into account developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions  and has been achieving accommodative financial conditions accordingly Under QQE with Yield Curve Control  the Bank and the government can cooperate with each other while fulfilling their respective roles14 13 Therefore  changing the price stability target from a point to a range  say from 1 to 3 percent  could be regarded as a weakening of a commitment to monetary easing 14 For an academic discussion on a policy mix  see Bartsch  E et al  Its All in the Mix How Monetary and Fiscal Policies Can Work or Fail Together  Geneva Reports on the World Economy 23  December 2020  httpsvoxeuorgcontentitsallmixhowmonetaryandfiscalpoliciescan workorfailtogether 11 Thus  based on the assumption that the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control  it will conduct an assessment on the manner of operations and various measures such as asset purchases Whether to make changes to various measures depends on the findings of the assessment  so it is not appropriate to make any specific comments at this point That said  the assessment will be conducted with the following points in mind First  the Bank should conduct effective monetary easing while containing socalled costs of policy measures as much as possible QQE with Yield Curve Control is a framework for conducting monetary easing while striking a balance between costs and benefits  but it is necessary to seek more effective ways to conduct monetary policy in terms of finding such a balance Second  while it is expected that monetary easing will be prolonged  the Bank should enhance the sustainability of the conduct of monetary policy during normal times and be nimble in responding to changes in developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions The Bank could conduct monetary policy more flexibly in a prioritized manner depending on changes in such developments In conducting the upcoming assessment  I would like to emphasize that the Bank does not intend to tighten monetary easing It also does not aim at only containing costs of policy measures Rather  the Bank will consider how to be nimble in conducting effective monetary easing while taking care of costs So far  I have explained the Banks thinking on its monetary policy conduct Communication is an important factor in conducting monetary policy The central banks intentions are not necessarily interpreted in the way they meant  and some recent research has clarified this difficulty and proposed some ways to improve their communications15 The Bank has communicated widely to the public through various channels such as speeches  press conferences  opportunities to exchange views like todays meeting  its website  and SNS It will continue to make efforts and seek ways to explain its thinking on the monetary policy conduct  including the content of the upcoming assessment  as clearly as possible 15 As for the recent paper on how central banks should enhance their communications  see Candia  B  Coibion  O  and Gorodnichenko  Y  Communication and the Beliefs of Economic Agents  NBER Working Paper  no 27800  2020 12 III Current Situation of and Outlook for Kanagawa Prefectures Economy Next  I would like to talk about the economy of Kanagawa Prefecture As with Japans economy as a whole  the prefectures economy has picked up as a trend  although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID19 However  the pace of improvement is likely to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID19 continues In addition  the population of Kanagawa Prefecture is expected to start declining within the next few years  and the impact of the declining and aging population on the economy is likely to intensify However  the declining and aging population will not automatically lead to an economic decline The important thing is how to address and tackle the issue Kanagawa Prefecture seems to be very active in its efforts to achieve economic growth while looking to the future Here  I would like to focus on three of the most notable examples The first is the concentration of research and development RD centers While Kanagawa Prefecture has always had the largest number of people engaged in RD in Japan  the concentration of RD centers has accelerated in recent years For example  leading companies at home and abroad  as well as universities  have actively moved their RD facilities and campuses into the Keihin Coastal Area Life Innovation International Strategic Comprehensive Special Zone and the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama City  and these areas have become a major RD center in Japan Industryacademiagovernment research collaboration should give rise to internationally competitive leading industries  which will serve as an engine for technological innovation The second notable example is the development of logistics centers With its international trading ports of Yokohama  Kawasaki  and Yokosuka  Kanagawa Prefecture has long been a logistics hub for Japan  acting as a major window connecting the country with the rest of the world With the further development of the expressway network that directly connects to the capital  largescale logistics facilities equipped with stateoftheart equipment have started to be constructed one after another in recent years  mainly in the central part of the prefecture along these expressways More efficient and upgraded logistics will contribute to 13 raising productivity regardless of industry The importance of Kanagawa Prefecture as a key logistics hub is expected to continue increasing in the future The third example is developments linked to tourism Kanagawa Prefecture is blessed with many tourist resources  including Yokohama City  an urban tourist destination  Hakone  one of the best hot spring resorts in Japan  Kamakura  a place of history and culture  and ShonanEnoshima  an area for marine sports However  at present  the number of visitors to these tourist spots has been declining significantly with the COVID19 pandemic  and the situation has been extremely severe That said  I have heard that  even in this situation  many firms have responded flexibly to the changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic and have made efforts to meet the needs  for example  of those who want to stay longer in one place and enjoy leisure time and meals There is also active promotion of tourism from a longerterm perspective For example  Kamakura City is working to increase the number of tourists in response to the fact that the city is the setting for the 2022 NHK Taiga Drama the annual yearlong historical drama television series produced by NHK Japan Broadcasting Corporation Kamakuradono no 13nin 13 Samurais of the Kamakura Shogunate In addition  Yokohama City is scheduled to host the World Horticultural Exhibition in 2027 These various efforts are expected to boost further development of the tourism industry Kanagawa Prefecture has a long history of close ties with foreign countries It opened its ports to the world about 160 years ago with the arrival of Commodore Perry As it developed as the gateway to Japan  new cultures  knowledge  and ways of thinking flowed in along with people and goods  and the economy of the prefecture grew while taking them in with flexibility This flexibility  I believe  has been the driving force for the prefecture to respond to the recent various changes in the environment and has led to active efforts to foster and develop industry I hope that Kanagawa Prefecture maximizes its potential and continues to make strong strides toward further growth 14 Conclusion Lastly  I would like to briefly touch on the medium to longterm economic issues confronting Japan There is concern that the COVID19 shock we are facing will remain for a long time as scarring effects16 In Japan  after major shocks such as the bursting of the bubble economy and the GFC  their effects lasted for a prolonged period as sort of hysteresis effects peoples sentiment deteriorated and the growth rate suddenly decelerated Chart 14 It is important to avoid such scarring effects on the economy as much as possible in order to create a situation where Japans economy will return to a sustainable growth path without any sudden deceleration once the impact of COVID19 subsides Therefore  the top priority is to overcome the crisis as swiftly as possible at the same time  it is also important to strengthen the growth potential while making the most of lessons learned from this crisis While COVID19 has had a significant impact on social and economic activities  this also could be an opportunity to reform the economic structure that will strengthen the growth potential In fact  there have been various efforts to use information and communication technology ICT in such areas as telework and online medical care It is essential to see how society as a whole can make the most of the harsh experience of COVID19 Active investment  particularly in human capital  is necessary in order to strengthen the growth potential17 While the leading role in this regard falls on the private sector  the public sector will actively support their efforts In this regard  central banks can provide liquidity through lending but cannot spend money It is the private sector and the governments that can spend 16 As for concern over the impact of COVID19 on peoples sentiment  see Eichengreen  B  An Infrastructure Inoculation for Americas Recovery  Project Syndicate  January 13  2021

Policy  speech at a meeting with business leaders in Saga  September 2  2020  httpswwwbojorjpenannouncementspresskoen_2020ko200902ahtm In addition  in Japan  the amount of money that firms spend on capability development of their employees accounts for 01 percent of GDP This is lower than the ratio in other countries  which is 21 percent in the United States  18 percent in France  and slightly more than 1 percent in the United Kingdom  Germany  and Italy For details  see Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare  Ideal Human Resource Development that Varies According to Diversified Work Styles

                                   Philip Lowe The year ahead Address by Mr Philip Lowe  Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  to the National Press Club of Australia  Canberra  3 February 2021 Thank you for the invitation to address the National Press Club This is the third time I have had the privilege of doing so  but it is the first time here in Canberra The world has changed tremendously since my previous address in February last year a pandemic  the biggest contraction in output in generations  the closure of our borders  a very large fiscal stimulus  near zero interest rates and quantitative easing All that in just a year and none of it was predicted It was therefore with some trepidation that I titled my remarks today  The Year Ahead I did so  though  because at the start of a new year  I thought it important to explain how we are thinking about the Australian economy and monetary policy over the year ahead Before I do this  I would like to offer 3 observations on the year we have just been through The first is that Australians respond well in a crisis The second is that the economic downturn was not as deep as was initially feared and the bounceback has been earlier and stronger than we were expecting And the third is that as we start 2021  there is still quite a way to go before we reach our goals of full employment and inflation consistent with the target I would like to elaborate on each of these observations as they are relevant to the future The national response First  our national response As a community  we have pulled together in the common good and been prepared to do what has been necessary to contain the virus Our public administration and health systems have worked well in the public interest Governments responded quickly to the pandemic and decisive fiscal and monetary policy responses have helped many people Our banks also worked with their customers to help them meet their obligations Because of these collective efforts Australia is in a much better place than most other countries This is true for both the economy and the health situation An earlier and stronger bounceback My second observation is that despite the pandemic having very significant economic costs  the downturn was not as deep as we had feared and the recovery has started earlier and has been stronger than we were expecting Employment growth has been strong  as have retail sales and new house building Across many indicators  including GDP  the outcomes have been better than our central forecasts and often better than our upside scenarios as well As an illustration  in August our central forecast was that the unemployment rate would end 2020 at close to 10 per cent and still be above 7 per cent at the end of 2022 Graph 1 In our upside scenario  the unemployment rate was expected to end 2020 a little lower than 10 per cent  but still be around 7 per cent later this year Thankfully  the actual outcome for the unemployment rate has been much better than this  with the peak now looking to be behind us and the unemployment rate ending 2020 at 66 per cent Graph 1 1  7 BIS central bankers speeches It is reasonable to ask what explains these betterthanexpected outcomes There are 3 factors that I would like to point to The first is the success that Australia has had in containing the virus That success has meant that the restrictions on activity have been less disruptive than we feared It has allowed more of us to get back to work sooner and it has reduced some of the economic scarring from the pandemic As is increasingly clear from experience both here and overseas  the health of the population and the health of the economy are inextricably linked The second factor is the very significant fiscal policy support in Australia  which as measured by the change in the aggregate budget position is almost 15 per cent of GDP Graph 2 Most of this support has been delivered by the Australian Government  but the states and territories have also played a role too This support has been more substantial than was assumed in August and has made a real difference It has provided a welcome boost to incomes and jobs and helped front load the recovery by creating incentives for people to bring forward spending There has also been a positive interaction with the better health outcomes  which have allowed the policy support to gain more traction than would otherwise have been the case Graph 2 The third factor is that Australians adapted and innovated When the virus first came to our shores  many people hunkered down  but as the days wore on  households and businesses adjusted and changed what they do and how they do it This resilience has helped keep the economy going and kept people in jobs Many firms changed their business models  moved online  used new technologies and reconfigured their supply lines Households adjusted too  with spending patterns changing very significantly Some of the spending that would normally have been done on travel and entertainment has been redirected to other areas  including electrical goods  homewares and home renovations Online spending also surged  increasing by 70 per cent over the past year Graph 3 These changes in our spending patterns have been challenging for many businesses  but the ability and willingness of Australians to keep spending has helped the overall economy Graph 3 Still quite a way to go My third observation is that despite the positive economic news over recent months  we still have quite a way to go There is still very substantial spare capacity in the Australian economy The unemployment rate is higher today than it has been for almost 2 decades and many people cant get the hours of work they want And in terms of output  we remain well behind where we thought we would be when I spoke here in February last year Graph 4 When the National Accounts are published for the December quarter  they are likely to show that the level of GDP is 4 per cent lower than where we thought it would be a year ago This is a big gap Graph 4 2  7 BIS central bankers speeches On the nominal side of the economy  there is also a fair way to go In underlying terms  inflation is running at 1¼ per cent  well below the mediumterm target of 23 per cent And wage growth is the lowest in decades  with the Wage Price Index increasing by just 14 per cent over the past year Graph 5 Given the spare capacity that currently exists  these low rates of inflation and wage increases are likely to be with us for some time Graph 5 The year ahead This brings me to the year ahead In my view  we can draw some comfort from the year just passed Our ability to pull together and the earlierthanexpected bounceback are both positive developments and provide a basis for confidence about the future Yet even so  the path ahead is likely to be bumpy and uneven and it will be some time before we are back to full employment and have inflation back to the target As was the case in 2020  much depends upon the path of the pandemic The development of vaccines in record time is clearly good news It has reduced one of the big uncertainties and could provide the foundation for a vigorous and sustainable recovery in the global economy But this outcome is not assured  the global rollout of the vaccines faces challenges and there are a range of other uncertainties about the global economy  including trade tensions We hope for the best here  but we also need to be prepared for further setbacks in what remains a highly uncertain world The RBA will be releasing a full set of updated economic forecasts on Friday Today  I can provide the key numbers In preparing these forecasts we have assumed a rollout of the vaccines in Australia in line with current government guidance and that international travel remains highly restricted for the rest of this year Our central scenario is for the upswing in the Australian economy to continue  with abovetrend growth over the next couple of years Graph 6 GDP is expected to increase by 3½ per cent over both this year and 2022 Given the recovery we have seen so far  we are expecting the level of GDP to return to its end2019 level by the middle of this year  which is 6 to 12 months earlier than we previously expected Graph 6 Notwithstanding this recovery  we are not expecting the level of GDP to return to its previous trend over our forecast period This is largely because of lower population growth When we prepared the forecasts a year ago  we were expecting the population to grow by 16 per cent per year over 2020 and 2021 The actual outcome is likely to be around 02 per cent in 2021  the lowest since World War I Graph 7 This slower population growth has a direct effect on the size of our economy and means that we will not get back to the previous trend any time soon In per capita terms  we expect more  but not all  of the lost ground to be made up Graph 7 In the labour market  we are expecting the rate of unemployment to continue to decline In the central scenario  it is expected to reach 6 per cent by the end of this year and around 5¼ per cent by mid 2023 Graph 8 Job vacancies  job ads and business hiring intentions are at 3  7 BIS central bankers speeches high levels  which suggests continuing solid employment growth over the next few months Beyond that  some slowing in employment growth is expected when the JobKeeper program comes to an end in March Graph 8 Given this outlook  wages growth and inflation are forecast to remain subdued In the central scenario  wages growth is forecast to pick up from its current low rate  but to do so only very gradually and still be below 2 per cent at the end of next year Consistent with this  and the ongoing spare capacity in the economy  inflation in underlying terms is also forecast to stay below 2 per cent over the next couple of years the central forecast for 2021 is 1¼ per cent and for 2022 it is 1½ per cent Graph 9 In headline terms  inflation is expected to spike to around 3 per cent in the June quarter  largely reflecting swings in the prices of child care and some other administered prices  but then to return to below 2 per cent by the end of this year Graph 9 So that is the broad outline of the central scenario We will also be publishing downside and upside scenarios  as we did last year The downside scenario is one in which there is a combination of further sporadic domestic outbreaks  a delay in the rollout of vaccines and a worsening global outlook The upside involves further good news on the health front  with a strong pickup in consumer and business confidence propelling a stronger selfsustaining recovery  especially given the large amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus that is in place In the downside scenario  further progress in reducing unemployment is delayed and there is a little pickup wage growth and inflation from current levels In the upside scenario  the unemployment rate falls faster to be a bit below 5 per cent in the second half of next year I would like to highlight 2 specific issues that have a bearing on the forecasts The first is how households respond over coming months to the tapering of the fiscal and other support measures Unusually for an economic downturn  growth in household income has been quite strong  largely reflecting the support provided by fiscal policy Graph 10 Much of this extra income has been saved  with the household saving rate surging to 22 per cent in the June quarter This largely reflects the limited spending opportunities during the lockdowns  but it is also a response to the uncertainty that people felt about the future These extra savings have strengthened household balance sheets and mean that many people now have bigger financial buffers than they had previously Graph 10 The question is what comes next Over the next 6 months  aggregate household income is expected to decline as the pandemic support payments unwind Normally  when income falls  so too does consumption But we are not in normal times The extra savings over the past 6 months and the bigger financial buffers can support future spending  people will have more freedom to spend as restrictions are eased and be more willing to spend as uncertainty recedes So we are expecting the recovery in consumer spending to continue 4  7 BIS central bankers speeches But there are risks to the forecasts in both directions here On the downside  further bad news on the health front could see additional restrictions on activity and a renewed desire to save And on the upside  positive news on health and jobs could see people seek to catch up on spending and run down their extra saving buffers quickly So we are watching this area carefully One other important factor bearing on household spending is the housing market When I spoke here last year I discussed how falling housing prices was one of the factors that had contributed to sluggish growth in 2019 The dynamics in the housing market now look to be in a different phase  with prices rising across most of the country recently Graph 11 It remains to be seen how long this will continue  but sustainable increases in asset prices support household balance sheets and encourage spending through positive wealth effects Higher housing prices can also encourage additional residential construction But as housing prices rise again  we will be monitoring lending standards closely We would be concerned if there were to be a deterioration in these standards  but there are few signs of this at the moment Graph 11 The second specific issue I want to highlight is the outlook for investment Prior to the pandemic  there were concerns about the protracted period of low levels of non mining business investment Graph 12 Not surprisingly  when the pandemic hit  investment fell further Faced with a more uncertain environment and a drop in demand  many firms deferred investment plans and sought to derisk their balance sheets Spending on nonresidential construction has been particularly affected On a more positive note  there has been a welcome offsetting pickup in public investment  which is playing a strong counter cyclical role We are yet to see the same signs of a recovery in private investment that we have witnessed in household spending Investment is nonetheless expected to pick up as uncertainty recedes and demand increases An increase in private business investment is not only needed to support the economic recovery but also to build the productive capital stock that is needed for our future So this too is an issue we are watching carefully Graph 12 Monetary policy I would now like to turn to monetary policy At our meeting yesterday  the Reserve Bank Board reviewed the monetary policy measures announced last year and the outlook for the year ahead I would like to share the conclusions of this review with you The first conclusion is that last years monetary policy package is working broadly as expected and is supporting the economy Together  the bond purchases  the Term Funding Facility  the 3 year yield target and the record low cash rate have kept funding costs low for all borrowers and helped ensure that the banking system is able to provide the credit that is needed for the recovery They have also resulted in a lower value of the Australian dollar than otherwise Combined  the various measures have resulted in the RBAs balance sheet increasing from around 180 billion to 330 billion and a further substantial increase is in prospect Graph 13 Graph 13 5  7 BIS central bankers speeches The second conclusion is that very significant monetary support will need to be maintained for some time to come It is going to be some years before the goals for inflation and unemployment are achieved So it is premature to be considering withdrawal of the monetary stimulus The third conclusion is that we will continue to purchase bonds issued by the Australian Government and the states and territories at the completion of the current 100 billion program in mid April In reaching this conclusion  the Board considered 3 factors 1 the effectiveness of the bond purchases 2 the decisions of other central banks and 3 most importantly  the outlook for inflation and jobs With 3 months experience now  it is clear that the bond purchase program has helped to lower interest rates and has meant that the Australian dollar is lower than it otherwise would have been So  it has worked Australias government bond markets also continue to function well and the available evidence is that further purchases would not be a source of market dysfunction In terms of other central banks  most have recently announced extensions of their bond purchase programs  many running until at least the end of this year Given this  if we were to cease bond purchases in April  it is likely that there would be unwelcome upward pressure on the exchange rate And  third  in terms of the most important consideration  the outlooks for inflation and jobs  we remain well short of our goals  as I have already discussed Given these considerations and the fact that the cash rate is at its effective lower bound  the Board decided to purchase an additional 100 billion of government bonds at the completion of the current program in mid April These additional purchases will be at the rate of 5 billion a week  which is unchanged from the current program They will ensure a continuation of the RBAs monetary support for the Australian economy The fourth conclusion is that the Term Funding Facility will be maintained as it is Banks are able to draw on the facility up until end June  which means they will have the benefit of lowcost funding out to mid 2024 The Board would consider extending this facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding and credit conditions in the Australian financial system At the moment  there are no signs of this Fifth  the 3year yield target for Australian Government bonds will be maintained This target has helped anchor the Australian yield curve and reinforced our forward guidance regarding the cash rate Later in the year  the Board will need to consider whether to shift the focus of the yield target from the April 2024 bond to November 2024 bond In considering this issue the Board will be giving close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlooks for inflation and jobs It has made no decision yet The final conclusion is that the cash rate will be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as is necessary Graph 14 The Board has no appetite to go into negative territory and has done as much as it reasonably can with interest rates Before increasing the cash rate  the Board wants to see inflation sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range Meeting this condition will require a tighter labour market and stronger wages growth than we are currently forecasting It is difficult to determine exactly when this condition might be met but  based on the outlook I have discussed today  we do not expect it to be before 2024  and it is possible that it will be later than this So the message is interest rates are going to be low for quite a while yet The Reserve 6  7 BIS central bankers speeches Bank is committed to provide the support the economy needs as its recovers from the pandemic Graph 14 On that note  I wish you all the best for the year ahead Thank you for listening and I look forward to answering your questions 7
